Hey there,

Here is a small project about prime number utilizing various mathematical concepts regarding sieves. Additionally, this prime exploration is displayed on a 4-digit 7-segment display module.

Credits goes to Ricardo Moreno and its tutorial on how to use 4-digit 7-segment display with 74HC595 shift register IC where each digit is controlled by four PN2222 transistors. The circuit diagram and schematic were also designed by him.
